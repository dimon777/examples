Contains examples of using MxNet deep learning framework

Findings:

- Training on 4 GPUs machine is about 4 times faster then on single GPU.
- Calculating accuracy is an expensive operation.
- Calculating accuracy in multi-GPU models is tricky (at least to me). I hope there is a better way to do so, then in this code.
